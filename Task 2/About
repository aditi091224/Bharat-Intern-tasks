In this project, I completed the challenging task of developing a robust image recognition model. The model is implemented using Python and popular deep learning libraries.

-- Key Highlights:
- Dataset preprocessing and augmentation
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results
- User interface for testing custom images

-- Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
